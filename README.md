trcli - The TestRail CLI client
================================
TR CLI (trcli) is a command line tool for interacting with TestRail and uploading test automation results.

![Tests](https://github.com/gurock/trcli/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)


Configuration files
===================
Configuration files can be used to pass parameters, options, settings
and preferences to the trcli tool. The configuration files should be written in YAML format.

We expect only `key: value`, `---` and `...`.

### Example
Below is an example of a sample configuration file for the TestRail CLI.
```
host: https://fakename.testrail.io/
project: Mockup Automation Project
project_id: 10
username: myuser@name.com
password: StrongP@ssword
key: AGT9PBifAxgWEWNGQgh/-Dc7Dr/fWDvEkLJwPFLRn
file: \<PATH\>/result_file.xml
title: Daily Selenium smoke test
verbose: false/true
verify: false/true
silent: false/true
config: \<PATH\>/alternate_config.yml
batch_size: 20
timeout: 5.5
auto_creation_response: false/true
suite_id: 213
run_id: 12
```

Default configuration file
--------------------------
Default configuration file should be named `config.yaml` or `config.yml` and be stored in the same directory
as the trcli executable file. The default path for pip installation of executable depends on your system and python settings (venv).

Please check where trcli was installed by using `which trcli` or `where trcli` command
depending on the operating system.

Custom configuration file
-------------------------
Apart from default configuration file a custom one can be passed after -c/--config
as a parameter. For more details check [Command line](#Command-line) section.

Environment variables
=====================
It is possible to pass parameters and options to the trcli tool by setting environment variables.
The variable should be named as follows: TR_CLI_Parameter_name_capitalized

For example for -c/--config: TR_CLI_CONFIG

```
Note: One exception to this rule is for --yes/--no parameters.
One should use: TR_CLI_AUTO_CREATION_RESPONSE (false/true).
true - agree for auto creation<br>
false - do not agree for auto creation.
```

```
Note: In case there is a `-` in the parameter name it should be changed to `_`.
Example: for --project-id environment variable name will be TR_CLI_PROJECT_ID
```

```
Note: there are different ways of setting variables depending on system used.
Please make sure that value was set correctly.

example for setting environment variable (for single session) to string value:
set TR_CLI_PROJECT=project name for Windows
export TR_CLI_PROJECT="project name" for Linux-like systems
```

Setting parameters from different places
========================================
User can choose to set parameters from different places like default config file,
environment variables, custom config file, cli parameters or in some cases use
default values.
The priority (1-highest, 5-lowest) of setting parameters from different places is as follows:

| priority | source                |
|----------|-----------------------|
| 1        | cli parameters        |
| 2        | custom config file    |
| 3        | environment variables |
| 4        | default config file   |
| 5        | default value         |



Return values and messaging
===========================
trcli tool will return `0` to the console in case of success and value greater than `1` (usually `1` or `2`) in other cases.
Messages that are being printed on the console are being redirected to `sys.stdout` or `sys.stderr`.

Parsers
=======

Parsers are located in `/trcli/readers/`. To add new parser please read desired file and fill required dataclasses with the data (located in `/trcli/data_classes/`).

Available commands/parsers:

`parse_junit` - XML Junit files compatible with Jenkins and pytest reporting schemas
```
$ trcli parse_junit --help
Usage: trcli parse_junit [OPTIONS]

Uploading test results from Junit file
======================================

### Specification first:

TR CLI tool expects test case IDs to be present in the result file.
This means you can first create your test cases on TestRail and map them on your test code using the respective IDs.

### Code first (automatic test provisioning):

In case any test on the report does not have a test_id property (such as in the report example below), 
you will be prompted to automatically add the cases to TestRail. 
To use this feature, you must first add a [custom field](https://www.gurock.com/testrail/docs/user-guide/howto/fields/) 
of type `string` with system name `automation_id` on TestRail. 
This will allow the CLI tool to add the fully qualified test name (i.e.: `classname.name`) to the case and in future
imports be able to report results to the correct cases (assuming the test name and classname don't change).<br>
You can provide the ID of the test suite you want the cases to be created in using the `--suite-id` command line option,
otherwise the CLI tool will attempt to find the suite on TestRail by name.<br>
If you are using the CLI tool in a CI context, you can use the `-y` option to automatically accept all prompts.

### Example content of result_file.xml:
```xml
<testsuites name="test suites root">
  <testsuite failures="0" errors="0" skipped="1" tests="1" time="0.05" name="tests.LoginTests">
    <properties><property name="setting1" value="True"/></properties>
    <testcase classname="tests.LoginTests" name="test_case_1" time="159">
      <skipped type="pytest.skip" message="Please skip">skipped by user</skipped>
      <properties>
        <property name="test_id" value="12"/>
      </properties>
    </testcase>
    <testcase classname="tests.LoginTests" name="test_case_2" time="650">
      <properties>
        <property name="test_id" value="13"/>
      </properties>
    </testcase>
    <testcase classname="tests.LoginTests" name="test_case_3" time="159">
      <failure type="pytest.failure" message="Fail due to...">failed due to...</failure>
    </testcase>
  </testsuite>
</testsuites>
```


Multithreading
====================================
trcli allows user to upload test cases and results using multithreading. This is enabled by default and set to `MAX_WORKERS_ADD_CASE = 5` and
 `MAX_WORKERS_ADD_RESULTS = 10` in `trcli/settings.py`. To disable multithreading set those to `1`.

During performance tests we discovered that using more than 10 workers didn't improve time of upload and could cause errors. Please set it accordingly to your machine specs.
Average time for uploading:
- 2000 test cases was around 460 seconds
- 5000 test cases was around 1000 seconds

Unit Tests
==========

Running tests
-------------
Ensure testing libraries are installed. In the root directory, run:<br>
`python3 -m pip install -r ./tests/requirements.txt`<br>
To run all tests:<br>
`python3 -m pytest -c ./tests/pytest.ini -W ignore::pytest.PytestCollectionWarning --alluredir=./allure-results`<br>
List of all test markers can be found by running:<br>
`pytest --markers -c ./tests/pytest.ini`<br>
