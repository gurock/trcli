trcli - The TestRail CLI client
================================
TR CLI (trcli) is a command line tool for interacting with TestRail and uploading test automation results.

- Install the CLI tool on your system and run it as part of your build pipeline
- Automatically generate new test runs and upload results from automated tests
- Optionally create new test cases in TestRail for test cases scripted in your test automation suite

If you already have [Python](https://www.python.org/) with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed,

#### Uploading test results

When you upload a new JUnit XML file containing test automation results, the TestRail CLI will automatically generate a new test run with the test cases from your report file and upload the results.

To specify which test cases to add to the test run, the TestRail CLI will attempt to match the test cases in your automation suite to test cases in TestRail.

To allow for this, you must first add a new [custom field](https://www.gurock.com/testrail/docs/user-guide/howto/fields/) 
of type `String` with system name `automation_id`.

The TestRail CLI will use the unique combination of your automation test caseâ€™s classname and name (expressed as `classname.name`) to compare against values of the `automation_id` field in your TestRail test case repository.
If a match is found, this test case will be included in the auto-generated test run for this upload. 

Example:

| Test Result from Automation Results File                                               | Automation ID in TestRail   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| ```<testcase classname="tests.LoginTests" name="test_case_1" time="159"></testcase>``` | test.LoginTests.test_case_1 |

```
Important usage notes: 

1. If you would like to upload automation results for test cases that already exist in TestRail, be sure to update the automation_id for those test cases before uploading your automation results
2. If you change the test name in your automation suite later, that will create a new test case in TestRail, unless you also update the automation_id field for the test case in TestRail
```

When you upload your test automation results, the TestRail CLI will prompt you to choose how it should handle test cases that it cannot match in TestRail:
- If you enter `yes`, the TestRail CLI will automatically add new test cases in TestRail based on your automation test case, and add the `classname.name` value to the Automation ID field of the new test case.
- If you enter `no`, the TestRail CLI will not automatically provision a test case in TestRail and will ignore your test automation result

If you are using the CLI tool in a CI context, you can use the `-y` option to automatically accept all prompts.

You can also provide the ID of the test suite you want the cases to be created in using the `--suite-id` command line option, otherwise the CLI tool will attempt to find the suite on TestRail by name.<br>


Setting parameters from different places
----------------------------------------
User can choose to set parameters from different places like default config file,
environment variables, custom config file, cli parameters or in some cases use
default values.
The priority (1-highest, 5-lowest) of setting parameters from different places is as follows:

| priority | source                |
|----------|-----------------------|
| 1        | cli parameters        |
| 2        | custom config file    |
| 3        | environment variables |
| 4        | default config file   |
| 5        | default value         |


### Configuration files
Configuration files can be used to pass parameters, options, settings
and preferences to the trcli tool. The configuration files should be written in YAML format.

We expect only `key: value`, `---` and `...`.

Possible fields:<br>

| Field name             | description                                                                                                                               |

Below is an example of a sample configuration file for the TestRail CLI.
```yaml
host: https://fakename.testrail.io/
project: Mockup Automation Project
username: myuser@name.com
password: StrongP@ssword
file: \<PATH\>/result_file.xml
title: Daily Selenium smoke test
config: \<PATH\>/alternate_config.yml
batch_size: 20
timeout: 5.5
auto_creation_response: true
case_fields: 
  type_id: 1,
  priority_id: 3
```

#### Default configuration file
Default configuration file should be named `config.yaml` or `config.yml` and be stored in the same directory as the trcli executable file. The default path for pip installation of executable depends on your system and python settings (venv).

Please check where trcli was installed by using `which trcli` or `where trcli` command
(depending on the operating system).

#### Custom configuration file
Apart from default configuration file a custom one can be passed after -c/--config
as a parameter. For more details check the [Commands](#Commands) section.


### Environment variables
It is possible to pass parameters and options to the trcli tool by setting environment variables.
The variables should be named as follows: `TR_CLI_PARAMETER_NAME_CAPITALIZED`

For example, for `-c`/`--config`: `TR_CLI_CONFIG`

```
Note: One exception to this rule is for --yes/--no parameters.
One should use: TR_CLI_AUTO_CREATION_RESPONSE (false/true).
true - agree for auto creation<br>
false - do not agree for auto creation
```

```
Note: In case there is a `-` in the parameter name it should be changed to `_`.
Example: for --project-id environment variable name will be TR_CLI_PROJECT_ID
```

```
Note: there are different ways of setting variables depending on system used.
Please make sure that value was set correctly.

example for setting environment variable (for single session) to string value:
set TR_CLI_PROJECT=project name for Windows
export TR_CLI_PROJECT="project name" for Linux-like systems
```


Return values and messaging
---------------------------
trcli tool will return `0` to the console in case of success and value greater than `1` (usually `1` or `2`) in other cases.
Messages that are being printed on the console are being redirected to `sys.stdout` or `sys.stderr`.


Multithreading
--------------
trcli allows users to upload test cases and results using multithreading. This is enabled by default and set to `MAX_WORKERS_ADD_CASE = 5` and
 `MAX_WORKERS_ADD_RESULTS = 10` in `trcli/settings.py`. To disable multithreading, set those to `1`.

During performance tests we discovered that using more than 10 workers didn't improve time of upload and could cause errors. Please set it accordingly to your machine specs.
Average time for uploading:
- 2000 test cases was around 460 seconds
- 5000 test cases was around 1000 seconds
